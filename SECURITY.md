# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest tagged release is supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open public issues for sensitive vulnerabilities.

Use one of these:
1. GitHub Security Advisory (preferred).
2. Private disclosure to project maintainers.

Please include:
- Affected version/tag
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix + disclosure timeline.
